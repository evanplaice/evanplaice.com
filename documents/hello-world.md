Welcome... This will (hopefully) be the first of many posts. Some will be informative. Others will be controversial. A few will inspire thoughts of violence and visuals of sharp objects flying in my direction.

This site has been a long-time coming. I mean a *really* *really* long time coming. See, I couldn't just throw up a WordPress blarg like some pleb. It had to be something 'special'. A reflection of my passion for chasing the bleeding edge. A Frankenstein of web technologies and best practices that's both interesting and horrifying.

**First, I had some overcome some cognitive dissonance**

The term 'blog' sounds like something 23 year old me would do after one too many JÃ¤germeister shots. To kill the mood further, the Web 2.0 evangelists paradigm shifted and synergized the culture of online sharing into 'blogosphere'.

*[I just threw up in my mouth a little...](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=throw+up+a+little+bit+in+my+mouth)*

I swear, this is the last post you'll hear me use the term 'blog' or any of its variants. If I fall back on my word, I encourage the maximum degree of public shame you can dish out.

**Then there was the aftertaste of too much self-congratulatory BS**

I have an allergy to pretension. Throughout my whole life I have consistently received praised for being 'really smart'. Independent of failings, successes, laziness, hard work, lackadaisicalness, and determination. Smart, never got me a damn thing. Hard work, a high degree of integrity, and a willingness to run toward challenges are the qualities I aspire to.

**So, why the sudden change of heart?**

For one, the IoN (Internet of Narcissists) has migrated to other platforms that better serve their superficial self-validation needs. The less interesting blogs devoted to 'writing about the writing process' and/or meta meta blogging are disappearing.

Through the valley of YouTube comment despair. Beyond the reach of the Reddit horde of Reddit trolls chanting 'Bro Job Choo Choo!'. I've discovered a diverse community of passionate and thoughtful individuals I don't know yet deeply respect. 

Mostly, it's because I absolutely love sharing knowledge, perspectives, and ideas with others. I learn the most by teaching, I gain the most by giving, and -- if all else fails -- I can talk out of my ass with the hope that somebody more knowledgeable shows up to steer me in the right direction.

If you made it this far, thank you for your patience. If you were hoping for a lot more substance and a whole lot less BS. No worries, this is just a pressure release valve. The good stuff is coming up.
