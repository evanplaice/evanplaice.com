Welcome... This will (hopefully) be the first of many posts. Some will be informative. Others will be controversial. A few will inspire thoughts of violence and visuals of sharp objects flying in my direction.

This site has been a long-time coming. I mean a *really* *really* long time coming. I have a sizable backlog of posts and a [GitHub profile](https://github.com/evanplaice) full of projects I'm itchin' to share. I wish I could come up with a better metaphor but the best way to describe the anticipation of finally having an online journal is.

Yep, just like that. Except -- you know -- without the sexual undertones, four decades of frustration, and hypothetical trunk to hold my imaginary bicycle.

**First, there were misgivings**

Just the term 'blog' sounds like something 23 year old me would do after too many JÃ¤germeister shots. Then -- to kill the mood further -- the Web 2.0 evangelists paradigm shifted and synergized their way to the 'blogosphere'.

*[I just threw up in my mouth a little...](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=throw+up+a+little+bit+in+my+mouth)*

I swear, this is the last time you hear me use the term 'blog' or any of its variants. If I fall back on my word, I encourage the maximum degree of public humiliation and shame you to offer.

**Then there was the aftertaste of too much self-congratulatory bull**

I have an allergy to pretension. Throughout my whole life I have consistently received praised for being 'really smart'. Independent of failings, successes, laziness, hard work, lackadaisicalness, determination. Smart, never got me a damn thing. Hard work, a high degree of integrity, and a willingness to run toward challenges are the qualities I aspire to.

**So, why the sudden change of heart?**

For one, the IoN (Internet of Narcissists) has been streamlined through new platforms (ex Twitter, Instagram) that offer maximum validation at ever decreasing barriers of entry. 

Mostly, it's because I absolutely love sharing knowledge, perspectives, and ideas with others. I learn the most by teaching, I gain the most by sharing, and -- if all else fails -- I can talk out of my ass until somebody more knowledgeable shows up to correct my ignorance.

If you made it this far, thank you for your patience. If you were hoping for a lot more substance and a whole lot less BS. No worries, this is just a pressure release valve. The good stuff is coming up.
